AtliQ Hotels, owning multiple five-star hotels across India, is facing challenges with market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. This project provides insights to help AtliQ Hotels regain their competitive edge through Business and Data Intelligence.

## Problem Statement

AtliQ Hotels, despite being in the hospitality industry for 20 years, are losing market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category due to strategic moves by competitors and ineffective decision-making. The managing director aims to incorporate “Business and Data Intelligence” to reverse this trend, despite lacking an in-house data analytics team.

## Key Metrics

- **Revenue Realized**: ₹1.69 billion
- **RevPAR (Revenue per Available Room)**: ₹7,337
- **DSRN (Days Since Last Room Night)**: 2,528
- **Occupancy Percentage**: 57.8%
- **ADR (Average Daily Rate)**: ₹12.70K
- **Realization Percentage**: 70.1%

## Recommendations

1. **Atliq Grands (Delhi)**: Despite good ratings, underperforms in revenue. Strategic plans needed to boost bookings and reduce cancellations.
2. **Atliq Palace (Hyderabad)**: Low bookings potentially due to low ratings. Attention needed for high ADR (₹9,480) and low Occupancy percentage.
3. **Atliq Grands (Hyderabad)**: Lower revenue linked to poor ratings and low Occupancy percentage. Focus on increasing bookings.
4. **General Strategy**: Low Occupancy percentages are the primary cause of revenue decline, resulting from fewer bookings. Enhance booking rates and adjust ADR dynamically based on city, weekdays, and low-demand days to maximize revenue.
